To generate a combined ranking of all methods (DeFAST, Sobol's method, DGSM) as in the manuscript, run combine_methods_fig.m. 
To generate ranking of each method independently, go to the directory of each method to run the figure generator code. 
All figures in this directory are generated based on pre-simulated data in this study. The data is stored under each method folder in this directory.
