To reproduce all model simulations and sensitivity indices calculations, please execute the function DGSM_HIV_main.m 

## Simulation time
We were rewarded with a start-up allocation of 50,000 SUs for Comet CPU at XSEDE (https://www.xsede.org/) for our study. Our code was running on 2 noded (24 cores each node). 

We provide below detailed description of all subroutine functions involved in the main function
